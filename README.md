 my Spiel would be cognitive. that stats are "m'eh" but the real game is showing decision makers  things that let them do things. so informative "visualizations" that highligtht the deltas between things (Kelly's personnel construct theory: folks dont know "things", what they really know are the minimal differences between things) .

which leads to the mathematics of diversity (entropy, variance) and how to distinguish between things (bootstrapping, effectSize) and how to apply that theory of differences to data mining (clustering, discretization, recursive tree learning).  

the final cherry on this cake would be scott-knot stuff seen at icse recently where  results are chunked up into BIG groups and we no longer focus on micro deltas but on BIG MOFO DIFFERENCES.

so not sure if that is an REU thing or a lecture for my foundations of software science thing in the fall

your call. happy to help. happy to not. what ya need?

# Maths that matters

Cognitive maths. Maths that fuels human decision making:

- explaination is task-depnedent: supervised learning rules (different atsks, different learning)
- Don't sweat the small stuff: effect size, scott-knott
- Maths of n-dimensional sphere: low-dimensional or not at all (+)
- Kelly's peresonnel constract theory: dont show what is, show what is different
- Minimize confusion: reduce expected value of variance or entropy

(+) note: cool if we are human intelligence. May not hold for super-human intelligence.
